Tic-Tac-Toe Readme:

Technologies used:

In order to construct this Tic-Tac-Toe game, I mainly used the coder VisualStudioCode. I used this in order to make all instances of the HTML, CSS and JS files.

HTML was used to make the structure to the page with things like divs and the header. 

CSS of course was used for page styling as well as formatting some of the inputs JS was making such as the background images that would be used as the 'X's' and 'O's'.

Javascript is the main backbone of this program. Javascript completes the main things behind the scene that makes this program tick. Such as the round counters and the counters being applied to the grid when clicked.

My approach:

My approach to creating this was mainly to firstly starting to construct the baseline HTML. Such as divs, inputs, headers and buttons. From there I focussed on the baseline css. Such as basic colour coding and aligning of my properties on the page.

Next, I would set up the main bulk of JS. Such as adding event listener and attaching functions to properties such as the divs and buttons. This JS setup will also incorporate the main functions like win conditions and draw conditions and of course the images that I am using instead of X's and O's.

The final portion will be cleaning up messy code, adding extras such as css animations and of course writing this README file.

Installation:

To install this code or play the Tic-Tac-Toe game it is as simple as cloning this repository from my GitHub: https://github.com/benlinehan1/Tic-Tac-Toe. There will also be link to play the game that can be found on my GitHub as well. The link to the actual website which anyone can access is: https://benlinehan1.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/.

Unsolved problems:

At this stage, I am happy with the progression of this program. However! I would have been even happier if I had found a more succint way to make the victory conditions work. I would have also preferred to have installed some Sound API's that could have added to the gaming experience. While I have added background music effectively with the ability to pause and unpause it, I would have liked to add sound effects for clicks on the grid. Logistically this could have been problemtic due to clashing with the background music however.


The Theme:

The theme of this Tic-Tac-Toe is one of my favourite points in time, the 2000's. More specifically, the 'Gen-z-ification' of the 2000's. I tried my best to make the website alike to one of those old school 2000's websites that were as equally basic as they were 'camp' in their design.

The other over-arching theme would be Girlbosses, I have attached photos and background music to the file of my favourite iconic girlbosses who deserve to be memorialised in my extraordinary Tic-Tac-Toe game.
