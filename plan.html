<!-- Plan for coding:

Day 1: 

On the first day my plan is to set up the 'bare bones' of my code. This will mainly focus around my HTML and Basic CSS. My main goal is to focus on setting up the 'board' that the Tic tac toe will be played on.

I will do this in HTML by using:

<div>'s as well as class tags assigned to them.

I will also do some basic HTML like a header with player information laid out as well as some input boxes below the board for player names.  

Basic CSS I will be doing will be the board layout such as the grid that it will be played on as well as minor page decoration. Such as fonts, background colours and aligning elements on the page.

I will do minor JavaScript on day one, mainly focussing on the inputting of names and moving them to their designated spots.

Day 2:

Day 2 will be very JavaScript heavy. This day I will mainly be focussing on setting up the Javascript for the gameboard as well as other related things. For the gameboard I am planning on using functions and event.target to change the background of the divs to images to represent each player's move.

I will also be handling things like the round counters and game counters, I am planning on incorporating the round counters in the click function so it can detect it each time. The victory counter will likely be held in the winCondition function.

I will also be making the winCondition function today. I am planning on potentially hardcoding the array number order they can win in. THen adding an area in the HTML where it will advise players of the victor. I am also planning on adding a board reset thing in there so all the images are cleared.

Day 3:

On day 3 I am planning on adding the finishing touches to the projec. Which will mainly focuss on CSS and styling. Taking it from 'Bare bones' to an elevated level. If that is completed I will move on to the bonus section. The main thing that interests me is Sound API's so I might consider including them in.

I will also do some formatting work, making sure my indentation is finalised and easily readable.

Of course, after this I will make my finished presentation and show off the finalised product.
